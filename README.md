## Project Abstract

The brainchild of project-based-learning; I tried my hand at learning HTML and CSS- two prominent front end languages- over the span of 3 days; after which I felt comfortable swimming by myself in deeper waters. I massed my interest in contemporary art, world travel, and this trending concept of minimalism, to create a minimalist gallery which features a html-css skeleton. I've run into some minor issues that need fixing which I've to-do-listed below.

## Run
- I've webhosted via Github pages; site [link](https://devarshi-ap.github.io)

## Minor Bugs

- texts' position isn't absolute, I forgot to make it responsive to tab size.
- If you find a fix, pull request or shoot me an email like a Neanderthal.
