                        <p>Trevi Fountain, or Fontana di Trevi, is an iconic fountain in Rome that is arguably a late
                            Baroque masterpiece. Though a fountain had existed at the location of the Trevi Fountain
                            since ancient times, it wasn't until 1762 where Nicola Salvi and Giuseppe Pannini designed
                            and completed it.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Intricately carved out of Travertine stone, the fountain depicts Oceanus, god of water, in
                            the center niche, flanked by Abundance and Salubrity. Below the gods are a number of hippocampus
                            and tritons adding symmetry to the fountain. At the top of the fountain sits the Papal Coat of
                            Arms, suspended by angels.</p>
