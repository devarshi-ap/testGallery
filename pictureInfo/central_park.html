                        <p>Central Park was designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, America's greatest landscape architect,
                            and Calvert Vaux in 1858; it was one of the first American parks to be developed using
                            landscape architecture techniques.</p>

                        <p>Arguably one of the most famous parks in the world, Central Park occupies an area of 840
                            acres and extends between 59th and 110th streets (about 4 km). Not only is it the first
                            public park built in America, but it is also one of the most frequently visited, with over
                            25 million guests per year.</p>
