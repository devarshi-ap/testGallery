                        <p>The Andromeda Galaxy also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224 and originally the Andromeda
                            Nebula, is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years from Earth and the
                            nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>The galaxy's name stems from the area of Earth's sky in which it appears; the constellation
                            of Andromeda, which itself is named after the Ethiopian (or Phoenician) princess who was
                            the wife of Perseus in Greek mythology.</p>
