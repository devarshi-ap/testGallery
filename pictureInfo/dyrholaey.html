                        <p>Dyrholaey, which translates to Door Hill Island, is of volcanic origin and was once an island
                            before joining up to the Icelandic mainland. In ancient times, passing sailors used to refer
                            to Dyrholaey as 'Cape Portland'.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Dyrholaey's most instantly recognisable attraction is the promenade's massive rock arch, a
                            result of centuries of erosion. As a result, its name is in direct reference to this enormous arch</p>
