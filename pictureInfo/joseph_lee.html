                        <p>Joseph Lee is an artist who's work focuses on the parallel between external reality and internal
                            process. The beauty in Lee's work stems from the manipulation of common everyday forms, such as faces
                            or objects, into an array of energetic and forceful expressions. Each segmented brush stroke
                            and application of color converge into a balanced whole.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Each painting expresses a sense of physical harmony by layering of palette and brush strokes
                            to create a complete and powerful gestural composition.</p>
