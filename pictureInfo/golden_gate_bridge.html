                        <p>Engineering wonder or colossal work of art? For many who drive or bike across, or simply
                            admire it from afar, the Golden Gate Bridge is both.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Vaulting across the miles wide strait for which it's named, joining San Francisco Bay with
                            the Pacific Ocean, the span opened May 28, 1937, after more than four years of construction.</p>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <p>Though the bridge links San Francisco's urban skyline with the hills of Marin County to the
                            north, it's far more than just functional. Mysterious when shrouded in fog, vivid when bathed
                            in the supple light of the bay, it remains a timeless symbol of a city.</p>
                    </li>
