                            (Christ the Redeemer) gazes out upon a city celebrated more for the pleasures of its flesh
                            than for the saintliness of its sculptures.</p>

                            (2,296.6 ft.) tall Corcovado Mountain, Christ the Redeemer is one of the most recognised and

                            statue of Jesus in the world (the largest being the Christ is King statue in West Poland).</p>
