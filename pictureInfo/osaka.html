                        <p>Osaka Castle is a Japanese castle in Chuo-ku, Osaka, Japan. It's one of Japan's most famous
                            landmarks and it played a major role in the unification of Japan during the sixteenth
                            century of the Azuchi-Momoyama period.</p>

                        <p>In 1583, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, a powerful feudal lord and warrior, built Osaka Castle
                            during a period of unrest. Obsessed with gold, Hideyoshi insisted that it be applied to much
                            of the castle's interior furnishing, with this motif also appearing on the exterior awnings
                            to this day. Upon completion, Hideyoshi held the castle as a stronghold, which led to a
                            secession of the wars that were raging in Japan at that time- essentially unifying the country
                            and bringing temporary peace.</p>
