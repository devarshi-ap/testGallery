                        <p>In may 2016, a Basquiat sold for $57.3M. One year later, another painting of his from 1982,
                            Untitled, sold for $110.5M. Basquiat is not the first painter to have a canvas sell for a
                            price that strikes ordinary people as obscene</p>

                        <p>Basquiat became famous in the early 80s, when the idea that artists were supposed to be
                            commercial innocents fell apart for good, and when the idea of the "art star"-a funnily
                            abbreviated inversion, of starving artist-first came into vogue.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>I think the idea that good art has to be an artist communicating some deep
                            thought about the world is as limiting as the folks who think art has to be pretty.</p>
